# GoreeCloud Public Websites — Feature Roadmap

**Status:** Active roadmap control  
**As of:** 2026-09-15  
**Authoritative project record:** Project Record — Public Websites  
**Canonical repository:** GoreeCloud/static-websites
**Drive control:** `GoreeCloud/Feature Roadmap/GoreeCloud Public Websites/FEATURE-ROADMAP.md`

## Purpose

This file is the repository-side feature roadmap control for GoreeCloud Public Websites. It records current planned and recommended feature work without replacing the authoritative project record, implementation evidence, release gates, or GoreeCloud Tasks Management.

## Roadmap

| ID | Feature / obligation | Priority | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PW-001 | Reconcile all fourteen static website packages on authoritative `main` to the current GLAZE UI 1.4.1 Stable contract, with per-site evidence and acceptance. | High | In progress / evidence-gated |
| PW-002 | Complete the provider-side Labs deployment cutover from the accepted central source and exact production acceptance. | High | Unified `/labs/` path live; per-site exact production acceptance and legacy retirement pending |
| PW-003 | Complete the Manager public informational website deployment cutover while preserving the separate `manager.goreecloud.com` authenticated application boundary. | High | Unified `/manager/` path live; `manage.goreecloud.com` redirect verified and `manager.goreecloud.com` application boundary preserved; per-site exact production acceptance and legacy retirement pending |
| PW-004 | Require reviewed source/build, rendered-accessibility, deployment, and exact deployed-revision evidence before recording new production acceptance. | High | Ongoing release gate |
| PW-005 | Migrate public informational/static websites to `https://www.goreecloud.com/<website-slug>`, including `/glaze-ui`, `/wardveil`, `/suite`, `/labs`, and `/identity`; reserve `https://<application>.goreecloud.com/` for the actual web application. Preserve required compatibility and require per-site production verification before acceptance. | High | In progress / unified www production cutover and 13 legacy informational-host redirects verified; per-site metadata, GLAZE UI 1.4.1, rendered/accessibility, exact-revision acceptance, and legacy retirement pending |
| PW-006 | Add reusable commerce capabilities for applicable GoreeCloud websites, including product and service catalogs, product/service detail pages, customer reviews, testimonials, product/service Q&A, shopping cart, checkout, order confirmation, and account-linked order history where applicable. The commerce architecture should remain reusable across GoreeCloud websites rather than duplicating independent cart/order implementations per site. | Unprioritized | Planned / not implemented or production-verified |
| PW-007 | Use **Stripe and PayPal as the preferred external payment-processing integrations** for GoreeCloud website commerce instead of building a GoreeCloud payment processor. GoreeCloud should own the storefront, cart, order, customer, tax/shipping/discount orchestration, payment-status model, and branded checkout experience while delegating sensitive payment processing to the selected providers. The implementation must avoid storing raw card numbers or CVVs, verify provider webhooks/events before changing paid/refunded state, keep provider identifiers and payment metadata separated from sensitive credentials, and use a provider-neutral internal payment abstraction so Stripe, PayPal, or future approved providers can be integrated without rebuilding the commerce core. Provider-supported methods such as cards, eligible digital wallets, PayPal checkout, subscriptions, invoices, and refunds may be enabled only when supported, deliberately configured, and verified for the applicable GoreeCloud site. | Unprioritized | Planned requirement / no implementation or payment-provider production acceptance verified |
| PW-008 | Use a **Cloudflare-first hosting and cost model** for the planned commerce-capable public websites: keep static delivery on Cloudflare, use Workers/Pages Functions for dynamic server-side behavior, and use Cloudflare-managed data/storage services such as D1 and R2 where they fit the verified architecture. Begin development and low-volume validation on applicable free allowances, then move to Workers Paid or other required paid Cloudflare capacity before production commerce when reliability, quota, or feature requirements justify it. Do not purchase or operate a VPS or always-on local server solely for this commerce work unless a verified technical requirement cannot be met appropriately on the Cloudflare platform. Revalidate Cloudflare and payment-provider pricing before production launch because provider pricing and quotas may change. | Unprioritized | Planned hosting/cost requirement; no commerce production plan purchase or capacity acceptance verified |

## Current evidence baseline

Authoritative `main` registers fourteen centralized static website packages, and the Glaze UI lifecycle registry identifies 1.4.1 as current Official Stable. Source-side URL namespace preparation was implemented through PR #96 at merge revision `6a5c70292857ea3ccbc922585f7a905195cd92bb`. The existing `goreecloud-website` Cloudflare Pages project now builds the unified repository-root www namespace with `python3 scripts/build_www_namespace.py` and output directory `dist`, and public readback confirms all fourteen governed `www.goreecloud.com` path destinations are reachable.

The account-level Bulk Redirect Rule `goreecloud-website-url-migration` is enabled against `goreecloud_website_url_migration` with 13 permanent legacy informational-host redirects. The original 12 legacy hosts are verified, and `manage.goreecloud.com` now redirects to `https://www.goreecloud.com/manager/` with query strings preserved. PR #98 merged as main revision `6029da3313b570cc730ebf24c475eda905f5064e` to distinguish the legacy Manager informational hostname from `manager.goreecloud.com`, which remains reserved for the actual Manager application, and Cloudflare Pages successfully deployed that exact revision to `goreecloud-website`.

Final migration acceptance remains open because some mounted sites still expose stale canonical/design-system metadata, current GLAZE UI 1.4.1 per-site conformance is not yet established, and per-site rendered/accessibility/indexing/exact deployed-revision acceptance, old Pages-project/reference cleanup, nested legacy-path compatibility where applicable, and legacy-source retirement remain pending.

PW-006 through PW-008 record planned commerce, payment-processing, and hosting/cost requirements only. Their presence in this roadmap is not evidence that commerce, checkout, Stripe, PayPal, subscriptions, refunds, webhooks, wallets, order processing, D1, R2, Workers-based commerce services, paid Cloudflare capacity, or related production controls have been implemented, configured, purchased, certified, or accepted.

## Commerce and payment architecture requirements

The planned commerce layer should separate GoreeCloud-owned commerce state from provider-owned payment processing. Product/service catalog data, carts, orders, customer-facing status, shipping/tax/discount logic, reviews, testimonials, Q&A, and account relationships should remain under GoreeCloud control. Stripe and PayPal integrations should be adapters around a provider-neutral payment contract rather than becoming the primary domain model for orders or customer accounts.

Payment credentials and reusable secrets must remain in approved secret-management/runtime configuration and must not be stored in ordinary documentation, source files, public website assets, logs, or client-side configuration beyond provider-issued publishable identifiers specifically designed for that use. Payment state changes must be idempotent and evidence-backed, with signed/verified provider events used to reconcile authorization, capture, failure, refund, dispute, subscription, and cancellation state where applicable.

The design must minimize PCI-sensitive scope by relying on provider-hosted or provider-tokenized payment collection where practical. GoreeCloud must not collect or persist raw PAN/card-number or CVV data as part of this planned website-commerce architecture.

## Cloudflare hosting and cost planning baseline

**Verified external pricing baseline as of September 15, 2026.** These figures are planning inputs, not permanent GoreeCloud constants. Revalidate them against Cloudflare's current official pricing before any production purchase, capacity decision, or cost forecast.

- **Static assets:** Cloudflare Pages and Workers Static Assets currently treat static-asset requests as free and unlimited when the request does not invoke dynamic Worker/Function code.
- **Workers Free:** current account limit is 100,000 dynamic Worker/Pages Function requests per day.
- **Workers Paid:** currently has a minimum charge of **$5 USD per month per account**, includes 10 million requests per month and 30 million CPU milliseconds per month, and charges for usage beyond the included amounts under Cloudflare's current metered pricing.
- **D1 Free:** currently includes 5 million rows read per day, 100,000 rows written per day, and 5 GB total storage. Cloudflare now enforces the daily free-tier query limits; when they are exceeded, queries fail until the daily reset or the account is upgraded.
- **D1 Paid:** current Workers Paid allowances include 25 billion rows read per month, 50 million rows written per month, and 5 GB storage before metered overages.
- **R2 Standard free tier:** currently includes 10 GB-month of storage per month, 1 million Class A operations per month, 10 million Class B operations per month, and free internet egress under the documented R2 pricing model.
- **Stripe and PayPal:** payment-processing charges are separate from Cloudflare infrastructure charges and remain controlled by each payment provider's current pricing and transaction terms. Do not hard-code provider transaction fees into long-lived GoreeCloud planning without revalidation.

- Cloudflare Pages Functions pricing: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/pricing/
- Cloudflare D1 pricing: https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/pricing/
- Cloudflare R2 pricing: https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/

### Cost-planning direction

Use the free allowances for development, prototypes, and low-volume validation where they meet the actual technical and reliability requirements. Before production commerce launch, evaluate real request volume, D1 query patterns, R2 storage/operation volume, payment webhook volume, failure behavior at free-tier limits, and provider requirements. Upgrade to Workers Paid or other needed capacity when the production acceptance criteria require it rather than purchasing server infrastructure preemptively.

A VPS or always-on local server remains an exception path for this commerce architecture, not the default. Introduce one only when a verified workload requires capabilities that the chosen Cloudflare services cannot appropriately provide or when a separately governed self-hosting requirement controls the workload.

## Maintenance and synchronization

This roadmap and the corresponding Drive `FEATURE-ROADMAP.md` must remain materially synchronized with one another and with the authoritative project or service record. Update both copies whenever feature scope, priority, dependency, implementation status, cancellation, supersession, recommendation, verification state, or materially relevant hosting/cost assumptions change.

No feature may be represented as complete or Stable solely because it appears in this roadmap. Completion and lifecycle claims require the applicable authoritative implementation, validation, review, release, provider configuration, security/privacy review, capacity/pricing validation where relevant, and production evidence.

## Reconciliation rule

At each material feature change, reconcile this roadmap against the current authoritative project record, repository implementation state, applicable platform-system requirements, payment-provider integration state, current hosting/provider constraints where relevant, and GoreeCloud Tasks Management. Missing obligations, stale status, duplicated work, roadmap drift, undocumented disposition changes, or stale material pricing assumptions are defects to correct.
