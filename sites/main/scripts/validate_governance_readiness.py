"""Validate GoreeCloud production-readiness governance for the public website.

The website is currently an anonymous static publication surface. The multi-user
baseline is therefore explicitly Not Applicable to the current architecture, while
security readiness and Glaze remain mandatory. This validator makes that scope
classification reviewable and fails if the implementation or CI stops carrying the
controls that justify it.
