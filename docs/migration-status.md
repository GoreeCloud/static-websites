## Current state

Source consolidation and GLAZE UI V1.3 source/build reconciliation are complete for the fourteen authoritative static website packages on canonical `main`.

Production deployment migration is proceeding site by site. **Security Center, Privacy Center, Identity Center, GoreeCloud Suite, and the Continuity Center / Everkeep are `production-verified`.** The other nine packages remain `legacy-source` until their own Cloudflare source cutover and exact production verification are completed.

Labs became the fourteenth authoritative package through PR #63, merged as `2f635261f792bd815de9a9a09aa6fb7d6f0b55e7`. Its exact reviewed PR head passed the dedicated Labs build/browser workflow and repository-wide validation before merge. The canonical `labs.goreecloud.com` hostname was subsequently observed still serving the older Labs publication, so Labs remains `legacy-source`. The central package now carries fixed-host exact-byte/header verification and live Chrome acceptance tooling for use only after a separately verified Cloudflare source cutover. Indexing release remains an independent gate.

Everkeep is accepted at exact central revision `61378be3248a38f51c9f5560967a03298a288454`. The Cloudflare GitHub App reported a successful `goreecloud-everkeep` deployment for that exact revision, while an independent repository workflow rebuilt the reviewed artifact and verified the canonical live domain rather than trusting provider deployment status alone. Canonical-domain HTTP verification and live Chrome verification both passed.

The corrected Suite publication remains accepted at exact central revision `807adc08c955e37711ec6ba2c64a656d3bff0bfb`. The earlier Suite deployment at revision `f03b0c5d62f870a52fda286636771db2a34d3aaf` remains valid historical evidence for the incomplete 27-product publication but is not the current accepted Suite revision.

Production verification is independent per site and per materially changed publication revision. A central source build, CI pass, another site's successful cutover, a deployment-provider success check, or an older accepted revision never establishes production acceptance for changed public bytes.

## Mandatory consolidation rule

Every GoreeCloud standalone static public website must be stored, maintained, and referenced from `GoreeCloud/static-websites` unless an explicit governed architectural exception is approved.

Application frontends, authenticated product UIs, extension pages, generated artifacts, test fixtures, internal/debug pages, demos, reference pages, and inherited upstream documentation are not reclassified as standalone websites merely because they contain browser-renderable files.

No legacy repository may remain a second website source authority after its site's deployment and retirement gates are complete.

| Site | Domain | Central path | Migration state | Deployment state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main | `www.goreecloud.com` | `sites/main` | `validated-in-central-repo` | `legacy-source` |

The manifest remains the machine-readable controlling registry for these states.

## Suite portfolio correction and reacceptance

The prior V1.3 migration incorrectly treated an older 27-application Initial Suite Registry as a complete current portfolio. A newer authoritative Suite specification preserves a September 1 baseline of 38 application/service cards, and later project specifications establish additional Suite products. The canonical Drive inventory was reconciled to **45 verified products across 9 functional product groups**.

The corrected directory restores products that were wrongly dropped from the recorded baseline and includes later verified products. Shared Integral Platform Systems and application-centered capability identities retain their separate authority boundaries and are not inflated into the 45-product count merely because they integrate with the Suite.

PR #42 added a stronger production browser gate and exposed a real 320-pixel horizontal-overflow defect. The defect was corrected before merge. After exact revision `807adc08c955e37711ec6ba2c64a656d3bff0bfb` published, the production workflow initially detected stale live bytes, waited until exact convergence, then passed the full HTTP and live Chrome gates. Suite therefore remains `production-verified` for the corrected 45-product publication.

## Production-verification evidence

### Security Center

Security Center was verified after Cloudflare Pages was cut over to the central repository using `main`, root `sites/security`, build command `python3 website/build.py`, and output `website/dist`. The successful production deployment was tied to central revision `256daf235066b4fd1f931e50e45e366fa92f45e7`.

Live verification established HTTP 200 for the canonical root, HTTP 404 with fail-closed cache behavior for an intentionally missing path, committed security headers, GLAZE UI `1.3.0`, exact Glaze source revision `8354308445da9ac35ced2b37a7f503a08a0aaf72`, and successful rendered review.

See `docs/production-verification-security-2026-09-10.md`.

### Privacy Center

Privacy Center was verified after Cloudflare Pages was cut over to the central repository using `main`, root `sites/privacy`, build command `python3 website/build.py`, and output `website/dist`. The successful production deployment was tied to central revision `80379f6962a5ded6c01317542941a2c55aedd922`.

Live verification established canonical root/404 behavior, committed security headers, GLAZE UI `1.3.0`, exact Glaze source revision `8354308445da9ac35ced2b37a7f503a08a0aaf72`, exact production Git blob SHA `4c3ad293ba9196e2e5a32700b530ec67fd01cef6` for `/assets/glaze-v1.3.0.css`, and successful rendered review.

See `docs/production-verification-privacy-2026-09-10.md`.

### Identity Center

Identity Center was verified after Cloudflare Pages was cut over to the central repository using `main` with root `sites/identity` and no build step. The successful Cloudflare Pages deployment was tied to exact central revision `43141921a2c4915dd6e536dfa7af8d5da70a3319` by the Cloudflare GitHub App deployment check.

Public DNS resolved the canonical `id.goreecloud.com` hostname to the Pages project. Live verification established canonical root and explicit missing-path behavior, committed security headers, GLAZE UI `1.3.0`, exact Glaze source revision `8354308445da9ac35ced2b37a7f503a08a0aaf72`, and a canonical sitemap.

See `docs/production-verification-identity-2026-09-10.md`.

### GoreeCloud Suite

GoreeCloud Suite is production-verified at exact central revision `807adc08c955e37711ec6ba2c64a656d3bff0bfb` using `main`, root `sites/suite`, build command `python3 scripts/build_public_site.py`, output `dist`, and Cloudflare Pages project `goreecloud-suite`.

Independent live verification established exact equality for reviewed publication bytes, committed response headers, true HTTP 404 behavior, GLAZE UI V1.3 provenance and blob integrity, canonical Suite URLs, 45 products in 9 groups, and successful live Chrome rendering at 1180, 768, 390, and 320 pixels.

See `docs/production-verification-suite-2026-09-10.md`.

### Continuity Center / Everkeep

The Continuity Center is production-verified at exact central revision `61378be3248a38f51c9f5560967a03298a288454` using `main`, root `sites/everkeep`, build command `python3 scripts/build_public_site.py`, output `dist`, and Cloudflare Pages project `goreecloud-everkeep`.

The Cloudflare GitHub App reported a successful deployment for that exact revision. Independent production workflow run `34665929669`, job `103477685732`, rebuilt the exact reviewed artifact and then verified the canonical live domain. The HTTP gate passed for exact root, explicit 404, sitemap, robots, site CSS, canonical Everkeep identity, exact Glaze bytes, committed headers, canonical host behavior, and Cloudflare delivery. The live Chrome gate passed at 1180, 768, 390, and 320 pixels with canonical URL, expected core/authority content, exact GLAZE UI V1.3 identity, and all images loaded.

User-provided rendered review also showed the expected Continuity Center production surface without an obvious layout failure. This visual evidence supplements the exact automated gates.

See `docs/production-verification-everkeep-2026-09-11.md`.

## Authority boundaries

These production decisions apply only to public website deployments. They do not establish Wardveil runtime protection, Privacy Shield authorization, Identity runtime acceptance, Suite product runtime readiness, Everkeep Recovery Ready state or recovery/failover authority, Mesh authority, Manager state, or any other platform execution claim.

## Legacy-source retirement remains separate

`production-verified` does not mean `legacy-source-retired`. GoreeCloud's Wardveil, Privacy Shield, Identity, Suite, and Everkeep project repositories retain their non-site project/runtime authority. Former website subtrees or deployment references may be removed only after Cloudflare, automation, rollback, documentation, and preservation dependencies are independently cleared.

## Remaining production migration sequence

Nine initial production acceptance actions remain for the nine sites that still show `legacy-source`.

For each site or materially changed publication:

1. use the exact centralized source/build/output contract;
2. verify the custom production domain and successful deployment of the exact reviewed central revision;
3. verify HTTP status, security headers, explicit 404 behavior, GLAZE UI V1.3 markers, assets, navigation, and rendered behavior;
4. bind the result to the exact deployed central Git revision;
5. only then advance that publication to `production-verified`;
6. retire any legacy website source only after its separate dependency/rollback/preservation review passes.

## Immediate next action

Proceed next with **Mesh Center** production-cutover preparation. The central `sites/mesh` package already contains deterministic public build, source/artifact validation, an explicit `404.html`, and a read-only production deployment verifier. Before reconnecting Cloudflare, review and harden its rendered/browser production gate and reconfirm the exact Cloudflare root/build/output contract. Then cut over `mesh.goreecloud.com`, bind the provider deployment to the exact reviewed central revision, and independently verify the canonical live site before changing its deployment state.
